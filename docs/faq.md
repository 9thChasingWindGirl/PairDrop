    How to save images directly to the gallery on iOS?
</summary>

Apparently, iOS does not allow images shared from a website to be saved to the gallery directly.
It simply does not offer the option for images shared from a website.

I created a simple iOS shortcut that takes your photos and saves them to your gallery:

    Are there any Third-Party Apps?
</summary>

Here's a list of some third-party apps compatible with PairDrop:

1. [Snapdrop Android App](https://github.com/fm-sys/snapdrop-android)
2. [Snapdrop for Firefox (Addon)](https://github.com/ueen/SnapdropFirefoxAddon)
3. Feel free to make one :)

    What about the connection? Is it a P2P-connection directly from device to device or is there any third-party-server?
</summary>

It uses a P2P connection if WebRTC is supported by the browser. WebRTC needs a Signaling Server, but it is only used to establish a connection and is not involved in the file transfer.

If your devices are paired and behind a NAT, the public TURN Server from [Open Relay](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/) is used to route your files and messages.

    What about privacy? Will files be saved on third-party-servers?
</summary>

None of your files are ever sent to any server. Files are sent only between peers. PairDrop doesn't even use a database. If you are curious have a look [at the Server](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/pairdrop/blob/master/index.js).
WebRTC encrypts the files on transit.

    What about security? Are my files encrypted while being sent between the computers?
</summary>

Yes. Your files are sent using WebRTC, which encrypts them on transit. To ensure the connection is secure and there is no MITM, compare the security number shown under the device name on both devices. The security number is different for every connection.

    Transferring many files with paired devices takes too long
</summary>

Naturally, if traffic needs to be routed through the turn server because your devices are behind different NATs, transfer speed decreases.

As the public TURN server used is not super fast, you can easily [specify to use your own TURN server](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop/blob/master/docs/host-your-own.md#specify-stunturn-servers) if you host your own instance.

Alternatively, you can open a hotspot on one of your devices to bridge the connection which makes transfers much faster as no TURN server is needed.

- [Library to open a hotspot on Linux](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot)

You can also use mobile hotspots on phones to do that. 
Then, all data should be sent directly between devices and your data plan should not be charged.

    Why don't you implement feature xyz?
</summary>

Snapdrop and PairDrop are a study in radical simplicity. The user interface is insanely simple. Features are chosen very carefully because complexity grows quadratically since every feature potentially interferes with each other feature. We focus very narrowly on a single use case: instant file transfer. 
We are not trying to optimize for some edge-cases. We are optimizing the user flow of the average users. Don't be sad if we decline your feature request for the sake of simplicity. 

If you want to learn more about simplicity you can read [Insanely Simple: The Obsession that Drives Apple's Success](https://www.amazon.com/Insanely-Simple-Ken-Segall-audiobook/dp/B007Z9686O) or [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).
