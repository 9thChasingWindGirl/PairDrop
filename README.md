# Pairdrop 

[Pairdrop](https://pairdrop.net): local file sharing in your browser. Inspired by Apple's Airdrop. 

Developed based on [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop)

## Differences to Snapdrop

### Device Pairing
* Pair devices via 6-digit code or QR-Code
* Pair devices outside your local network or in complex network environment (public wifi, company network, Apple Private Relay, VPN etc.).
* Paired devices will always find each other via shared secrets even after reopening the browser or the Progressive Web App
* You will always discover devices on your local network. Paired devices are shown additionally.
* Paired devices outside your local network that are behind a NAT are connected automatically via [Open Relay: Free WebRTC TURN Server](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/)
